\section{Evaluating Test Cases for Non-functional Requirements}
We will be evaluating the non-functional requirement test cases used by Longsword Navigation
The criteria used is as follows:
\begin{itemize}  
\item The variety of test cases used with regards to a minimum of 3 of the non-functional requirements used during our own testing
\item The usefulness of test cases
\item How efficiently the test cases were used 
\end{itemize}
It was discovered that no apparent non-functional test cases were used by the previous team. It is for this reason that we give the group \textbf{0} for this section \\\\
\textbf{Score : 0/10}
