\section{Introduction}

	\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
	
	This section discusses and rates 10 non-functional requirements of the NavUP system.
	Below is the analysis of the Navigation module Interface and all its component classes:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Documentation:}
			The module as a whole is well documented. The relavent documentation tools were used effectively. [\textbf{Mark: 10/10}]
			
		\item \textbf{Efficiency:} The module is as efficient as it can be with the current tools and resources used. [\textbf{Mark: 8/10}]
		
		\item \textbf{Maintainability:} The project has good module cohesion, as a result it is easily maintainable. [\textbf{Mark: 8/10}]
		
		\item \textbf{Quality:} The module follows a consistent coding standard throughout all its component classes. The code itself is readable with little effort. [\textbf{Mark: 7/10}]
		
		\item \textbf{Reuseablity:} Due to the explicit requirements of NavUP, not all of the modules are easily reuseable. However slight tweaks to some modules is enough to be able to reuse them effectively. [\textbf{Mark: 5/10}]
		
		\item \textbf{Testability:} Testing the code for this module was very easy especially with the different mock tests made available to us.[\textbf{Mark: 9/10}]
	
		\item \textbf{Complaince:} This project does comply with the specification given to some extent, however there was some missing functionality. [\textbf{Mark: 5/10}]
	
		\item \textbf{Robustness:} The code here does handle a fair amount of exceptions and unexpected termination and thus is quite robust.[\textbf{Mark: 7/10}]

		\item \textbf{Cohesion:} The code is quite coesive as it leads into itself quite well. Modules interact with each other and the code ends up working well with all its parts.[\textbf{Mark: 10/10}]\\
